        <h3>Software Developer Intern, Tyler Technologies</h3>

        <p class="small">Summer 2014</p>

        <p>I made a RESTful API for a large Silverlight application with a C# back-end. I also worked on a responsive
            thin client written in HTML5/CSS/JavaScript which uses the aforementioned API. The core business logic was
            written in C#, with unit testing done in Jasmine and the MS Unit Testing Framework. The thin-client web app
            was written in TypeScript, AngularJS, jQuery, Bootstrap, and LESS.</p>

        <h3>Website Designer and Developer, Georgia Tech</h3>

        <p class="small">2013-2014</p>

        <p>I created a beautiful, engaging, and responsive website and user experience for a web-based project written
            in PHP. I also wrote a sophisticated PHP survey for a research study.</p>

        <h3>Computer and IT Coordinator, National Youth Science Foundation</h3>

        <p class="small">Summer 2013</p>

        <p>I coordinated and provided networking, computer access, and IT support services for a month-long, prestigious
            science camp. My responsibilities also included mentoring students, teaching, organizing, and overseeing
            classes.</p>

                Tech Challenge using a simple but powerful "<span class="focus">click, command, create</span>" workflow.
                With Catalyst, you can get your robot running in minutes, with little to no programming experience.</p>

        <h3>Cadet Commander, Aircraft Maintenance and Manufacturing Academy</h3>

        <p>I lead and organized a national week-long, residential academy that taught participants about aircraft
            manufacturing and maintenance on the live production floor. I managed, coordinated, and organized
            transportation, scheduling, activities, housing, meals, paperwork, special guests, press releases, and a
            plethora of other logistical tasks. The academy was very successful and lead to an award.</p>

        <h3>Cadet Commander, Harry S. Truman Composite Squadron</h3>

        <p>I lead a squadron of cadets, organized cadet programs, maintained discipline and professionalism, and

        <p>I developed a cross-platform, hybrid mobile application that leverages the powerful EnerGov RESTful API I
            worked on during the internship. I also developed an AngularJS directive that transforms tabular data into a
            fully responsive, touch friendly grid, complete with toggle controls and intelligent auto-switching based on
            screen size. Technologies used: JavaScript, AngularJS, Ionic Framework, Bootstrap, and LESS.</p>

        <h3>Preliminary acceptance to the <span class="focus">SpaceX</span> Internship Program</h3>

        <p>I was one of the 15 high school seniors selected in 2013 for SpaceX's inaugural internship program for FIRST
